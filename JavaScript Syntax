use //
ex) var number = 5; // in-line comment

- multi line comment:
/* this is a multi-line comment */
start and end /* */

# Data Types
- undefined, null, boolean, string, number, symbol, object
- variable (var / let / const)
var can be used through whole program, let is for only the scope, const is a variable that you should never change.

# Storing values with the assignment operator
var a;  <- declaring operator
var b = 2;  <- declaring and assigning

a = 7;  <- already declared so this is just assigning.

console.log <- see things in console

# Initializing Variables w/ Assignment Operator

# Incrementing Numbers
var a=2;
a++;          <- 3
a--;          <- 1

# Compound Assignment with Augmented Addition
a+=1;

# Escape Sequences in Strings
\'  single quote
\"  double quote
\\  backslash
\n  newline
\r carriage return
\t tab
\b backspace
\f form feed
